Science -  A curiosity for the subject. Sparked from a YouTube channel I love to dive into any science, learn the why behind things. Learning more only to find that there’s EVEN MORE to learn. Ex: Biology, learnt about DNA Cells, organelles, etc. Only to find out about epigenetics and the entire universe existing within that. Leaves me genuinely excited and wanting to learn more about this. Which is why I am self-studying for fun. 

Social Studies – Tying into my passion for debate I enjoy discussing questions with no “right” answer. Starkly contrast to my more scientific side is pondering and discussing these questions and trying to see things from diff. perspectives and watching as to how that completely warps your viewpoints, opinions and thoughts is fascinating.

VI. What do you consider your two most important academic achievements in the past three years? 
Why? 40 words or less.

Saving my social studies and English grade after missing a month of school on a family trip to India + my cousin brother got cancer (good and recovering now) Especially hard considering this was Pre IB not just regular grade 10 class. 

VII. ADDITIONAL PROJECTS: Provide a list and description of additional academic-related projects you’ve undertaken beyond the school curriculum. .-(list down in bullet points please) 


App development (PocketDoc App):

This app trained on millions of research papers and knowledge on medicine and diseases takes a top down approach using ML model to ask users dynamic follow up questions from reported symptoms to try and reach an accurate  diagnosis and provide helpful home remedies and OTC medications
.
The Problem: saw the problem, the health crisis in Canada severe lack of equitable access to healthcare. (2 weeks waiting for a family doctor appointment)
My brother was sick (high fever, cough, and reporting nausea), my mom was unable to  book an appointment (full). ER rooms had 6-8 hours waiting. Everyone was on their phone googling, jumping between articles all offering diff treatments and diagnosis. Very unreliable and sketchy. 


Growing interest in AI and ML decided to create an app that can diagnose diseases. 
App development was a new realm so I undertook a steep learning curve. Watched a 37 hour yt tutorial + lots of research into AI and ensuring how to create this technology. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8 (37 hour course)
Started building the app and model, numerous and tons of bugs along the way
Parsing in different formats
Managing plug in issues and the connectivity of different elements of the app
Dependencies
Smaller bugs such as data handling and uploading to cloud     
Learning how to package and run the app efficiently
Learning to design and build a aesthetic and functional UI
All were solved through independent research from youtube, reddit, stack overflow, and my own critical thinking skills and experience. 
Reached out to 3 different AWS developers to gain feedback on my app
Cold emailing + a connection who works at AWS
Provided valuable insight to improve app performance speed, usability, and a critical data parsing bug that I was having trouble fixing. 


Finally when the app was ready to launch there were 2 MAJOR Problems. 
A) Costs. The service (Infermedica) that I was using for a free trial in the development phase costs a minimum $10k a month. Critical to my app as it handled all the medical data parsing and processing.


B) Regulatory Issue. Unbeknownst to me at the time, an app that aims to provide health advice needs a medical device license. Really stringent testing requirements, resources required that were far out of my scope. 


How did I solve these 2 major issues: 
Infermedica issue: Decided to strip the need for this costly service entirely. 
Had to remove all current integration, this was time consuming as I had to essentially remove Infermedica without damaging any other aspects of the application which it was so closely intertwined with
Using Open AI’s Large Language Models as a base for the knowledge I decide to train my own top down ML model to diagnose diseases and ask dynamic high level questions like a doctor. And offer helpful home remedies and OTC medication
Meant collecting my own data, running hundreds of test runs to fine tune the model 
And then re integrating it into my app to completely replace Infermedica. 
From $10k a month to around $0.04 per diagnosis session.  


Still working on the second problem


Key Learning:
I learn the language flutter, building a backend system with Firebase, and azure, GCP platform and controls, programming in Dart, and how to build and deploy a full scale mobile application. 



Transferable skills:



Any Science Lab I take it a step further
Example the elastic lab for grade 10, took it to a much higher level of data and analysis. 
Testing the correlation between how far a rubber band is stretched and how far it is launched
Supposed to be intro to formatting a lab. 
Proceeded to designing a custom rubber band launcher to allow for controlled ways to ensure band is launched consistently
Used elastic equations extra research to convert units into Joules and study how energy is transferred from potential to kinetic, and observing how much energy is lost to other factors. 
Key Learning: Pushing my love for science, out of pure curiosity, learnt so much more excel and formulas, kinetic and elastic energies. 


 Impactivate Engineering (scraped and pivoted to BC stem OPpportunities as we saw there was the real need there. )
Nonprofit for STEM Education (In progress work on this over summer)
impactivate.ca
Organizational management skills
Leadership
First time presenting myself (organization) to the world. The gargantuan task of entering the real world as a stranger and marketing, garnering support and trust
Our Journey So Far:
Organizational Structure and Priorities: After becoming incorporated, our first task was to clearly outline our organizational structure and priorities. We decided to split into two major branches:
Teaching Division: Currently our main focus, this division aims to educate elementary and middle school students in STEM subjects through in-person lessons to ensure quality learning.
Impact Division: This branch invites individuals to work on real, tangible projects that can positively impact our community and the world. Examples of potential projects include developing robots to fill sidewalk cracks and conducting research studies on various diseases.


Website Development: Our website, arguably the most important face of our organization, went through numerous drafts and prototypes. After extensive effort, we are proud to present our current website: Impactivate Engineering (https://www.impactivate.ca/).


Community Outreach: Although we were running behind our planned schedule, this Monday we visited 12 different elementary schools in Langley and Clayton, seeking the opportunity to present our summer STEM courses. Due to the end-of-year timing, we were advised to follow up via email, which we have done, and we are currently awaiting responses.

Overall a great and will continue to be a learning experience of stepping into the real world out of my comfort zone. Leadership skills, teamwork, management, communication, dealing with so so so much rejection. 



Research Paper on base systems for math class:
https://www.overleaf.com/project#
Once again a simple project where we research on a base system and talk about it. Purpose to get us introduced to writing in mathematical language
Ran a real empirical study using my knowledge in data science and python to analyze how good a base 3 system would be compared to base 2 in efficiency and data storage. 
Key Learning: Pure curiosity, love for subject, and fun! Project wasn’t even for marks. Starting to get into writing research papers and found my joy for conducting investigations, answering questions, and doing science!

VIII. Resilience is a trait highly valued by universities. Tell us about a time you overcame a difficulty or a challenge (academic, social, etc).
App development going through bugs, so much learning
PocketDoc - app.pocketdoc.me
App meant to give instant AI diagnosis using smart ML models asked questions like a doctor. xt
As in any app lots of bugs and errors, revisions to make the app work. Took a 37 hour flutter course: 
Flutter Course for Beginners – 37-hour Cross Platform App ...YouTube · freeCodeCamp.org1 day, 12 hours, 39 minutesFeb 24, 2022
Sometimes the API isn’t working, something isn’t showing up, app is running slow, countless other errors. 
Once app was done a major steback that I was unaware of, regulatory issue because it classified as a medical device. 
Currently trying to get the approval but a lengthy process
Adapting approached clinics to find new use cases to adapt my app to and current idea is, 
No diagnosis but intelligent follow up questions for patient onboarding. Helps streamline appointments use less doctor time and improve quality. 
Key Learning so far: Learning to deal with large setbacks and roadblocks. Finding ways to preserve. Tons of learning how to develop a full stack application. A break into the healthcare industry, understanding EMR’s EHR’s and how patients are served and connected. 


Engineering club Getting proper funding was hard. 
 Founded Engineering Club → Goal is to bring Ideas into reality
The first year was focussed on lessons and bringing everyone to the same page. Me and 2 of my friends taught students on 3d design, modeling, programming, electronic circuits, the process of bringing an idea into a plan. 
Second year when we are actually ready to start hit massive roadblock. Funding. No money for an inherently expensive activity.
Approached local businesses for sponsorships, mcdonalds, local cafe, banks, fuel stations, offices. 40+ business and were rejected by all
Approached school and held a meeting in front of PAC to justify our case and received $400
Held a fundraiser selling our own designed 3D trinkets and toys, raised $500. 
With the money we bought basic materials tools,m a 3d printer. Begun working on a rocket project however did not finish as ran out of time in the school year, continuing next year. 
Key Learning: Friendship, connections, learning to be a leader and once again, dealing and overcoming challenges.

Early Voices of Parkinson’s: Machine Learning for Optimal Early Parkinson’s Detection
What if the key to protecting your loved ones from Parkinson’s disease was hidden in their voice? Today, Parkinson’s diagnosis relies on the clinical observation of motor symptoms, but by then the damage is already done. Leveraging AI, I created a novel system that can analyze your voice to detect Parkinson’s long before traditional diagnostic methods with 98.3% accuracy and 0 false positives. I built and compared three different computational approaches: traditional machine learning models, a novel deep learning approach trained on spectrograms, and a hybrid system that combined the two via a fusion layer. In the process of developing, I created the largest voice-based Parkinson’s dataset to date, a robust feature extraction pipeline, and carefully balanced clinical relevance with model performance. My findings show that AI voice detection hold potential to be a powerful and accessible screening tool for Parkinson’s, especially in remote and underserved communities.

Voice-Based Parkinson’s Screening Tool
Voice-Based Parkinson’s Screening Tool
Developed an award-winning AI screening system for early Parkinson’s using a curated dataset of 302 sustained “/ah/” recordings from public mPower/UCI sources and hospital volunteers. Acoustic feature pipeline extracted 22 biomarkers—including jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio, recurrence period density entropy and fractal dimension—using Praat and librosa, then standardized via pandas and scikit-learn. Three tabular models (XGBoost, Random Forest, shallow neural network) trained with SMOTE balancing and 5-fold stratified cross-validation achieved up to 96.6% AUC and 89.7% accuracy. A complementary deep learning pathway converted samples to 224×224 mel-spectrograms for transfer learning on EfficientNet-B0 (TensorFlow/Keras) with noise injection, time-stretching and pitch-shifting augmentations, reaching 97.6% AUC, 92.3% accuracy and 100% precision. A hybrid ensemble fused model outputs via grid-searched weights to deliver 98.3% AUC and 94.5% accuracy—20% above prior benchmarks. End-to-end workflow managed by Git/GitHub Actions CI, DVC for dataset versioning, MLflow experiment tracking and AWS S3 storage. HIPAA-compliant data collection with clinical partners and validation on smartphone-captured recordings ensured real-world robustness and clinical relevance.
